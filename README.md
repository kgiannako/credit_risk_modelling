# credit_risk_modelling
Built a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan default based on borrower data. Applied logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models to classify borrowers as "low risk" or "high risk.". Evaluated model performance using AUC-ROC, precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices to account for the asymmetrical costs.
